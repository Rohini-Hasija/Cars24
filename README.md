Data Cleaning & Data Modelling: Before doing analysis of Cars data first, an initial Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process was conducted to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. I did Data Cleaning in excel Power Query remove unwanted rows and in the original data only RTO location is given so in power query editor I add city using RTO data which  is available on Google. After that I do Data Modelling in Power Bi .

Suggestion:
Check on Petrol and Manual Cars: Since petrol cars make up 79.46% of the cars listed on cars24 and manual cars make up 80.38% of the total cars, it is clear that there is a significant demand for petrol cars in the used car market. They should emphasize showcasing petrol cars and highlight their advantages such as better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs. This can attract a larger pool of potential buyers and drive more sales.
Consider Mileage and Number of Owners in Pricing Strategy: The analysis revealed a correlation between mileage, the number of owners, and car prices. Cars with low mileage and fewer owners tend to command higher prices. They should take this into account when pricing their inventory.
As hatchback cars have shown high demand and longevity, it would be wise to stock a variety of hatchback models (like Maruti Swift) to cater to the preferences of potential buyers.
